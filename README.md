## About Me
- Hello everyone, I am Jared Subr, a fourth year student at Wright State University studying Computer Science. I love developing games!
- For 2025 I want to start tackling some game ideas I have. 
1. Top-down roguelike that has diablo-esque loot mechanics set in a cyberpunk city.
2. First-person action platformer that involves the player using a frisbee weapon.
